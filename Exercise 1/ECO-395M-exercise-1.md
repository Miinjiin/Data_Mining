## 1) Data visualization: flights at ABIA

Question: What is the best time of year to fly to minimize delays, and
does this change by destination?

Figure 1

Figure 1 shows that the best months to fly from Austin to minimize
delays are September - November. September has the least delays of all
(around one minute), while both October and September marked below 5
minutes of delay, which are still significantly less compared to other
months.

Next, we wanted to find out if the result changes by destination. We
picked six most popular destinations, which are Dallas Love Field
Airport (DAL), Denver International Airport (DEN), Dallas/Fort Worth
International Airport (DFW), George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH),
Chicago Oâ€™Hare International Airport (ORD), Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport (PHX), in the descending order. Figure 2 shows
that the overall trend of delays throughout the year is similar to that
shown by Figure 1. In general, September through November seems to be
the season with the least flight delays.
